        <p>Django is a Python-based free and open-source web
            framework that follows the model–template–views (MTV) architectural pattern.It is maintained by the
            Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established in the US as a 501
            non-profit.

            Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes
            reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle
            of don't repeat yourself.Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django
            also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated
            dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.

            Some well-known sites that use Django include Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, Bitbucket,
            Nextdoor and Clubhouse.</p>

            History
            Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper,
            Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired
            early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended.It was released publicly
            under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt.Adrian
            Holovaty is a Romani jazz guitar player and a big fan of Django Reinhardt.[citation needed]

            In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django in
            the future.</p>

            Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
            code readability with the use of significant indentation.

            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
            structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
            "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language
            and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new
            features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode
            support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with
            earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

            Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

            Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in
            the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of
            exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in
            December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until
            12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent
            dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as
            the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member
            Steering Council to lead the project.

            Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features.Python 3.0, released on 3
            December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python
            3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.

            Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
            of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or
            other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and
            later where supported, and later support for 3.6 also dropped.

            In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and so were older releases including 3.8.13, and 3.7.13
            because of many security issues in 2022. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were also expedited as all
            versions of Python had security issues leading to possible remote code execution and
            web cache poisoning.

            Python 3.6 (and every older release), is no longer supported as of 2021.
